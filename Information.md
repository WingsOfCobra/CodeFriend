# CodeFriend
This is the official Public repository of the CodeFriend Discord Bot.

**Information**

The CodeFriend Discord bot's code is not openly avaliable which means that you can't see the code of the bot for some reasons.
Maybe the Code will be published in the Future but for now the Bot is not open source.
The bot was 100% made by Cobra#0420 and it is written in Python with the official Discord.py Library.

I hope you have fun with this Discord Bot :)
